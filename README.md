# Hi there! 👋 I'm Dawid

I am an IT student at the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn and a member of the Artificial Intelligence Society "Czarna Magia." My primary focus is learning Machine Learning in Python with PyTorch.

## 🤖 About Me

- 🎓 Studying IT at the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn
- 🧠 Member of the AI Society "Czarna Magia"
- 🐍 Python enthusiast with a focus on Machine Learning
- 🔥 PyTorch and scikit-learn practitioner (but mainly PyTorch)

## 🚀 My Journey

I started my coding journey with web development, learning React and Next.js. However, my path took an exciting turn when I discovered AI art through early generative models. Fascinated by the potential of AI, I shifted my focus to Machine Learning. Since then, I've been honing my skills through Fast.ai courses and participating in Kaggle competitions.

## 🛠️ Projects

- [Sat2Map](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Kiwinicki/sat2map): A demo app for satellite image to map conversion, developed collaboratively within our AI club.
- [Face Expression Recognizer](https://github.com/knsiczarnamagia/face-expression-recognizer): A human face detector and expression classifier created with friends from our AI Club.
- [ArXiv Paper Converter](https://github.com/Kiwinicki/arxiv-paper-converter): A script that converts arXiv papers to clean Markdown format using the Gemini API. I use it as a help from LLM when I read papers.
- [Artificial Dreams](https://github.com/Kiwinicki/artificial-dreams): A web application enabling users to generate custom images using AI.
- [Personal Blog](https://github.com/Kiwinicki/Kiwinicki.github.io): My personal website where I'll be sharing more content soon.
